# Data Science Project

## Objective

The objective of this project is to investigate and visualize data using Python in the Jupyter Notebook environment. This assignment will test your ability to:
- Read data from files in Python,
- Manipulate the data,
- Describe the data using basic statistics,
- Produce non-graphical and graphical visualizations to explore the data,
- Communicate your findings as insights, and
- Self-learn new techniques from other resources to complement what is taught in this unit.

## Data

The data is presented in three comma-separated (CSV) files sourced from Kaggle, The World Bank, and The United Nations. The files should be obtained from Moodle and saved in the "data" folder (directory) where your Jupyter ipython notebook is. The data is:

1. **LifeExpectancyData-v2.csv**
   - Contains information related to life expectancy and health factors for 193 countries. The data is collected from the WHO data repository website, and its corresponding economic data was collected from the United Nations website.

2. **2019-GDP.csv**
   - Recorded Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of almost all countries in the world for the year 2019. There are 4 columns, but you will only need the last 2 columns, which are the country name and the GDP stated in US Dollars.
